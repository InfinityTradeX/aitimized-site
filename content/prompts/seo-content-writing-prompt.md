Topic: [YOUR TOPIC]
Target Keywords: [PRIMARY KEYWORD, SECONDARY KEYWORDS]
Target Audience: [DESCRIBE YOUR AUDIENCE]
Desired Length: [WORD COUNT]

Please structure the content as follows:

1. **Compelling Title**: Create an attention-grabbing title that includes the primary keyword
2. **Meta Description**: Write a 150-160 character meta description
3. **Introduction** (150-200 words): Hook the reader and explain what they'll learn
4. **Main Content**: 
   - Use H2 and H3 headings with keyword variations
   - Include 3-5 main sections
   - Add practical examples and actionable tips
   - Naturally incorporate target keywords (1-2% density)
5. **Conclusion** (100-150 words): Summarize key points and include a call-to-action

Additional requirements:
- Write in a conversational yet professional tone
- Include transition words for better readability
- Add relevant statistics or data points where appropriate
- Suggest 2-3 internal linking opportunities
- Recommend 1-2 external authoritative sources to link to
```

## How to Use

5. Optimize further based on your SEO tools' recommendations

## Tips for Better Results

- **Be Specific**: The more details you provide about your audience and goals, the better the output
- **Iterate**: Don't settle for the first version - ask for revisions
- **Add Examples**: Include 1-2 examples of the style you're looking for
- **Set Constraints**: Specify reading level (e.g., "8th-grade reading level")
- **Request Variations**: Ask for multiple title options or intro paragraphs

## Variations

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Keyword Stuffing**: Don't demand too high keyword density
2. **Generic Content**: Always add unique insights after generation
3. **Ignoring E-E-A-T**: Ensure content demonstrates expertise, experience, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness
4. **No Fact-Checking**: Always verify statistics and claims made by AI
5. **One-and-Done**: AI content is a starting point, not the finished product

## Expected Results

- **Quality Score**: 80%+ (requires human refinement for 95%+)
